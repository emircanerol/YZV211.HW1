However, using a high upper bound for land area that‚Äôs *still* a tiny % of the US prob helps convert some naysayers.

1578687993,2020-01-10 23:26:33,@RQuiddich Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank ‚Äî it‚Äôs just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don‚Äôt collapse when depressurized on the ground.
1578687850,2020-01-10 23:24:10,"@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
1578687650,2020-01-10 23:20:50,@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
1578674281,2020-01-10 19:38:01,"@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."
